# GameDer
## Pitch
Web application with rooms to connect people and find a common game to play with a Tinder app feature.

Each user will connect to a common room (eg: 3 friends) and will start scrolling (Tinder like) games based on their library (we’ll have a mode to switch with unowned games). Each user will then have to swipe right or left to tell if they might want to play the game.

When all users have found a game that they might want to play, the app pauses and display a message like “It’s a match, would you go for a game ?!”?

Add a feature to suggest games based on common interests or genres.
